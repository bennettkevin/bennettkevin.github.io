        <p>Hello and welcome to my page I'm Kevin Bennett an ambitious software developer dedicated to growing my network and knowledge in technology. 
          I am enrolled at GTCC currently with plans to attend University of North Carolina Greensboro for a Bachelors in Computer Science. Technology is something I have been passionate 
          about since childhood. My childhood free time was spent learning outside learning to build things like ramps for jumping my bike. This sparked a creative interest in me being able to take materials and turn
          them into something that had a use. This led to my passion for technology as I learned about video games learning what made them function was something of extreme interest to me. As I progressed towards the end of my 
          High School education learning to program became my outlet for this passion. My friends and I made a launcher and website for World of Warcraft this initial dive into coding had me convinced 
          that creating things with technology was what I wanted to do.
